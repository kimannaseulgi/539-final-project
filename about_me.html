        <p>I've always loved tea, coffee, and experimenting with different types of drinks. From a comforting cup of Korean barley tea to a bold espresso shot, each sip is an adventure. In the summer, iced milk teas or fruit teas are refreshing and cooling. In the winter, a warm cup of green tea or hot matcha is one of my favorite things to drink.</p>
        <p>On my website, I'll share my favorite teas, recipes, and tips on brewing the perfect cup. As most of these teas are sourced from Asia, I provide a brief description of each tea, the notes, in addition to where and what condition these tea leaves were harvested in.</p>
        <p>Fun fact: The circles located on each tea selection is an accurate representation of the color of the respective tea!</p>
